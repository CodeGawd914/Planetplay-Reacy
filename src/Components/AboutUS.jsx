      <p className="neon1h w3-text-black gilroy ">Planet Play was created by three moms who wanted to build an all inclusive space that sparked the imagination, encouraged play and activity, and catered to children of all ages. Recognizing that families and siblings differ in age and interest, we wanted to build an area where parents could bring their children and have something for everyone! With a variety of offerings, which include but are not limited to, virtual reality experiences, arcade games, a toddler area, a bounce house, a 700 square foot indoor jungle gym, and toddler and preschool classes.</p>
      <p className="neon1h w3-text-white gilroy">Planet Play is sure to provide families with an OUT OF THIS WORLD adventure! And parents, we havenâ€™t forgotten about you! Our Cosmic Cafe offers gourmet coffee and treats in a comfortable lounge area so you can relax while your children explore. If you are interested in open play, hosting a private birthday party, or attending one of our classes, then give us a call or stop in today!</p>

      In order to provide everyone with an OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURE, we have a few rules and policies that we ask everyone to abide by.
      <br></br>
      -Planet Play is a shoe and stroller free facility. Cleanliness is a top priority to us, as we want to keep all children and visitors healthy and safe. In order to do this, we do not allow shoes past a certain point. All guests must wear socks.
      *Socks can be purchased at the front desk*
      <br></br>
      -Planet Play is an all-inclusive facility. We welcome children of all abilities to come and experience our space. We do not tolerate bullying, fighting or rough play of any kind. Additionally, we ask that all guests respect the equipment and toys found within our space.  We reserve the right to refuse admittance to any guests involved in the above activities. We also reserve the right to remove any guests from the facility without a refund, if they partake in any of the said activities. Children will feel safe and comfortable in Planet Play at all times.
      <br></br>
      -Planet Play is a nut free facility. We understand the severity of food allergies and would never want to put children in a harmful situation. No outside food or drinks are permitted within the facility, and all of the offerings in the Cosmic Cafe are nut-free options. Additionally, no food or drink will be allowed outside of the Cosmic Cafe lounge area. We have plenty of seating options for you to enjoy while eating and drinking.
